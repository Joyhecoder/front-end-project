## About The Site
* Along the Way is an interactive website that allows the user to input a destination and find restaurants, gas stations, or weather after selecting a route. It is best used when you select a route and click somewhere along the route to find places that are not out of the way. The webpage uses remote API data to populate a list of potential places you might want to visit if you're planning a road trip.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Stretch Goals Completed
