# Along the Way


## About The Site
***
* Along the Way is an interactive website that allows the user to input a destination and find restaurants, gas stations, or weather after selecting a route. It is best used when you select a route and click somewhere along/near the route to find places that are not out of the way. The webpage uses remote API data to populate a list of potential places you might want to visit if you're planning a road trip.

## Built With
***
### Languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript


### APIs:
* Google API
* Rapid API (weather)
* Google API (again)
* Google API (AGAIN...probably)

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
***
* Designing a webpage to handle all of the data we need from our APIs
* Responsive design 
* Entering location info into the input fields will populate Google maps routes between both locations
* Local restaurant or gas station data is found wherever you click on the map after you input directions
* Weather data is found for the end destination

## Stretch Goals Completed
***
* Actually retrieving Google API data and getting a map to work on our webpage
* Getting waypoints to show up on map when you click on it 
* Clicking on card makes map pin highlight and jump
* Buttons don't stack info, i.e. clicking on restaurants after clicking on weather will override the weather and make it disappear, only showing restaurants
