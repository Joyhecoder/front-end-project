# Along the Way
## About The Site
***
* Along the Way is an interactive website that allows the user to input a destination and find restaurants, gas stations, or weather after selecting a route. It is best used when you select a route and click somewhere along/near the route to find places that are not out of the way. The webpage uses remote API data to populate a list of potential places you might want to visit if you're planning a road trip.
